CRITICAL WARNING: [Board 49-67] The board_part definition was not found for digilentinc.com:basys3:part0:1.1. This can happen sometimes when you use custom board part. You can resolve this issue by setting 'board.repoPaths' parameter, pointing to the location of custom board files. Valid board_part values can be retrieved with the 'get_board_parts' Tcl command.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_OV7670_VGA_Display/U_VGAController/U_Pix_counter/h_counter_reg[9]_1[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_OV7670_VGA_Display/U_VGAController/U_Pix_counter/zone_id_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell u_OV7670_VGA_Display/U_VGAController/U_Pix_counter/zone_id_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
WARNING: [DRC REQP-1840] RAMB18 async control check: The RAMB18E1 u_SCCB_core/U_SCCB_Controller/U_OV7670_config_rom/dout_reg has an input control pin u_SCCB_core/U_SCCB_Controller/U_OV7670_config_rom/dout_reg/ADDRARDADDR[9] (net: u_SCCB_core/U_SCCB_Controller/U_OV7670_config_rom/Q[5]) which is driven by a register (u_SCCB_core/U_SCCB_Controller/rom_addr_reg[5]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
