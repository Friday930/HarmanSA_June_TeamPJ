PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u_OV7670_VGA_Display/U_VGAController/U_Pix_counter/h_counter_reg[9]_2[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_OV7670_VGA_Display/U_VGAController/U_Pix_counter/zone_id_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell u_OV7670_VGA_Display/U_VGAController/U_Pix_counter/zone_id_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 u_OV7670_VGA_Display/U_Frame_Buffer/mem_reg_0_1 has an input control pin u_OV7670_VGA_Display/U_Frame_Buffer/mem_reg_0_1/ADDRARDADDR[14] (net: u_OV7670_VGA_Display/U_Frame_Buffer/wAddr[7]) which is driven by a register (u_OV7670_VGA_Display/U_OV7670_MemController/h_counter_reg[7]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
